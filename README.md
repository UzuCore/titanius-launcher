# Titanius Launcher

- Inspired by EmulationStation and AmberELEC
- Controller-first UI
- Unsophisticated
- No game scraper - uses gamelist.xml with folders supported
- No themes

## How to use

By design, Titanius Launcher does not come with a game scraper. 
The idea is to reuse your existing, pre-scraped roms library. 
So you can reuse the same roms library on both Linux devices that run AmberELEC, ArkOS, etc and your Android devices.

1. Arrange ROMs in a folder structure like this: [AmbeELEC](https://amberelec.org/systems/)
2. Use [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/) to scrape your ROMs and generate gamelist.xml files
3. Copy your ROMs into an SD card or the internal storage of your Android device
4. Configure Titanius Launcher to point to your ROMs folder
5. Enjoy!
